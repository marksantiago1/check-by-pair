        <p class="p1">The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are a very infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.
        The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom.[12] The crew sailed on the Going Merry,[13] their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.[14]</p>
